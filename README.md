# MDOTRED - M.R/MDR
M.RED is a programming language made by Matthew West. I learned most of the code used by a tutorial made by tylerlaceby.

## Developer Stuffs
This section shows everything developers might want to see. People can see this to edit the code or see what changed.

### Changelog
1. The warning message has been changed
2. A changelog has been added
3. isInteger function now uses the isNaN JS function
4. A keyword object has been added
5. Check if token is integer finished
6. Check if token is letter addedd. If ident is a reserved keyword add VarType TokenType

I also added the code at the end to run a test MDOTRED file and display the tokens

### Runtime & Language
I coded this language in Vanilla JS and it's run internally using the current NodeJS LTS version.

The first version of M.R was going to be written in TS with either a NodeJS experimental features version or Deno. This was changed to normal JS and a LTS ver. of NodeJS.

## Language Usage
We currently don't support other people using this language.
